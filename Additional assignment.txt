---------------------------------
file_obj = open(file_path) #File path is the complete path of the file to be read 
file_contents = file_obj.readlines()
type(file_contents)

Note : If your file is placed in the downloads folder then the file path would be as follows 

C:\Users\your_user_name\Downloads\name_of_the_file with_extension

Inorder to know the file path, do the following actions 
1)Right click on the file 
2)Select the properties options (this will open a window) 
3)Select the "Details" tab
4)Look at the property "File location"


If your username is JimHerald and file name is micky.txt in the downloads folder, the file path will look like the one below 

C:\Users\JimHerald\Downloads\micky.txt
